### Development Schedule ###
Day1:
+ Inheritance hierarchy and cordinates-based control.
Day2:
+ Integrate keypress.rb keystroke detection library into the game.
+ Wrote computer AI that can construct sequence of keystroke moves.

### How to Run ###
+ You need the latest versions of Ruby to run this game.
+ Download the repository and navigate into the directory using command line.
+ Once you are there, run the command <code>$ bundle install</code>.
+ After that's done, run <code>$ ruby lib/chess.rb</code> (You will be asked if you want to load a saved game. Choose n for now. If you want to save a copy of the game, you can do that during the game play using the ESC key).
